???:Hey, you. You are finally awake.
Alex:Where am I?
???:You know where this is, you been here before
Alex:..............
Alex:Its been a while since I last had this dream,
Alex:This nightmare rather.
Alex:I have been here countless time before but I've always been alone
Alex:So, why are you here this time? Who are you?
???:Me? I guess you can call me your guide through this place.
Alex:Why would I need a guide in a dream?
???:You don't want to keep having this nightmare forever do you?
Alex:But...isn't this my punishment
Alex:As the only one left, 
Alex:To hold on to a memory that I am not allowed to forget.
???:You don't have to forget but maybe its time to move on.
???:Turn those dark memories of regret into a bittersweet memory that you hold dear.
???:To make peace with them and to make peace with yourself.
Alex:I guess you are right..... they wouldn't want to see me waste away my life like this.
???:That's the spirit!
???:Trust me, follow my voice and let's get moving.
