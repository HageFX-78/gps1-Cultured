???:This is where all your battles will take place
Alex:Alright....But how do I fight them? With my fists?
???:You fight with your words and emotions
???:Every enemy carry with them 1 of the 5 emotions
???:Delusional, Hatred, Self Loathing, Despair and Righteousness
???:And you have 4 emotions
???:Rationality, Acceptance, Hope and Love
???:The goal of the battle is simple,
???:All you have to do is balance your enemy emotions in the safe zone with your words
???:The bar at the top shows your enemy's emotional status
???:The green area is the safe zone you are aiming for
???:Remember that both you and your enemy's words will affect the bar
???:You are given 4 dialogue options per turn
???:Each representing a separate emotion
???:You can also attempt to run from a battle but don't count on it working everytime
???:Now lets get started on the battle
???:Do you see how some words have different colours?
???:Those are your hints to the emotions being conveyed
???:[-Green] means the option is super effective against the enemy
???:[_Red] means the option is not effective against the enemy
???:Lastly,[=Blue] means you chose a neutral option
???:However know that they don't always show themselves
???:Why don't we start by choosing the [-Green] option
???:See how the bar moves to the left
???:It shows that your choices are effective against the enemy
???:After your turn, your enemy will then negatively impact their own emotions
???:Next, lets try out the [_Red] option
???:The bar moved to the right because you chose the non effective option
???:Similarly, the enemy will now play their turn
???:For the last turn, let's try the [=Blue] option
???:Notice how little it moved the bar but now you are in the safe zone
???:And that was the final turn,the battle always end on the player turn
???:Congratulations! You beat your inner demon
???:Now lets keep moving forward, I got a couple more things to teach you
Alex:The door seems to be locked
???:Why dont you try interacting with the switch over there
???:Press the spacebar to interact with an object
???:The next thing i need you to do is to help me look for something important
Alex: What is it?
???:Its something that once belongs to me, my glasses
???:Just walk around the area, you should find it 
???:Good, you found it!
???:What you just collected is the remnant of my soul
???:Its what keeping us here in your dream
???:You need to collect the remnants, bring it to the exit
???:And set us free
???:I believe in you, you can do it!
