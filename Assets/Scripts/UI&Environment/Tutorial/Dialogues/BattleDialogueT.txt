???:This is where your battles will take place
Alex:Alright...How do I fight them?
???:You will fight with your words
???:Each enemy carry 1 of 5 emotions
???:Delusional, Hatred, Self Loathing, Despair and Righteousness
???:And you have 4 emotions
???:Rationality, Acceptance, Hope and Love
???:The goal of the battle is simple,
???:You have to balance the enemy emotion in the safe zone
???:The bar shows your enemy's emotional state
???:The green area is the safe zone you are aiming for
???:Both you and your enemy's words will affect the bar
???:You are given 4 dialogue options per turn
???:Each representing a separate emotion
???:You can attempt to run from a battle but it won't always work
???:Now lets get started on the battle
???:Some words will have different colours 
???:They are hints to the emotions being conveyed
???:[-Green] means the option is super effective
???:[_Red] means the option is ineffective
???:And,[=Blue] means its neutral
???:However, they don't always show themselves
???:Lets start by choosing the [-Green] option
???:See how the bar moves to the right
???:It shows that your choices are effective
???:After your turn, the enemy's words will impact their own emotions
???:Next, lets try out the [_Red] option
???:The bar moved left because you chose the non effective option
???:Similarly, the enemy will now play their turn
???:For the last turn, let's try the [=Blue] option
???:Notice how little it moved the bar but now you are in the safe zone
???:And that was the final turn,
???:Congratulations! You beat your inner demon
???:Now lets keep moving forward!
Alex:The door seems to be locked
???:Why dont you try interacting with the switch over there
???:Press the spacebar to interact with an object
???:The next thing i need you to do is to help me look for something important
Alex: What is it?
???:Its something that once belongs to me, my glasses
???:Just walk around the area, you should find it 
???:Good, you found it!
???:What you just collected is the remnant of my soul
???:Its what keeping us here in your dream
???:You need to collect the remnants, bring it to the exit
???:And set us free
???:I believe in you, you can do it!
