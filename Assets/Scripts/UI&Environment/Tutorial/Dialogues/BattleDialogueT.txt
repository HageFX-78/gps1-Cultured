Guide:This is where all your battles will take place
Alex:Alright....But how do I fight them? With my fists?
Guide:You fight with your words and emotions
Guide:Every enemy carry with them 1 of the 5 emotions
Guide:Delusional, Hatred, Self Loathing, Despair and Righteousness
Guide:And you have 4 emotions
Guide:Rationality, Acceptance, Hope and Love
Guide:The goal of the battle is simple,
Guide:All you have to do is balance your enemy emotions in the safe zone with your words
Guide:The bar at the top shows your enemy's emotional status
Guide:The green area is the safe zone you are aiming for
Guide:Remember that both you and your enemy's words will affect the bar
Guide:You are given 4 dialogue options per turn
Guide:Each representing a separate emotion
Guide:You can also attempt to run from a battle but don't count on it working everytime
Guide:Now lets get started on the battle
Guide:Do you see how some words have different colours?
Guide:Those are your hints to the emotions being conveyed
Guide:[-Green] means the option is super effective against the enemy
Guide:[_Red] means the option is not effective against the enemy
Guide:Lastly,[=Blue] means you chose a neutral option
Guide:However know that they don't always show themselves
Guide:Why don't we start by choosing the [-Green] option
Guide:See how the bar moves to the left
Guide:It shows that your choices are effective against the enemy
Guide:After your turn, your enemy will then negatively impact their own emotions
Guide:Next, lets try out the [_Red] option
Guide:The bar moved to the right because you chose the non effective option
Guide:Similarly, the enemy will now play their turn
Guide:For the last turn, let's try the [=Blue] option
Guide:Notice how little it moved the bar but now you are in the safe zone
Guide:And that was the final turn,the battle always end on the player turn
Guide:Congratulations! You beat your inner demon
Guide:Now lets keep moving forward, I got a couple more things to teach you
Alex:The door seems to be locked
Guide:Why dont you try interacting with the switch over there
Guide:Press the spacebar to interact with an object
Guide:The next thing i need you to do is to help me look for something important
Alex: What is it?
Guide:Its something that once belongs to me, my glasses
Guide:Just walk around the area, you should find it 
Guide:Good, you found it!
Alex:This looks....familiar 
Alex:Wait....grandpa is that you?
Guide:Guess you caught me
Alex:What are you doing here?
