Peasant, it’s because of your incompetence that I’m here, how about you rot here alone in your own self-indulgent nightmare!!
Oh? Despite not knowing your own place, you’re coming straight to me? How about you look at yourself in the mirror and tell me how are you not like me? A parasite of the world.
Don’t talk to me please, why did you even come close to me!!!
The difference between you and I are boundaries beyond infinite, compared to the quality I possess *chuckles* I am undoubtedly the most handsome/prettiest of the entire universe while you……. compared to mere trash, are not even a speck worthy
I can’t believe you are still living that miserable life of yours. Looking back at myself, I feel like if I'm garbage, you are the bacteria that can’t live without garbage, the difference being no one can even see you.
Oh my god, im telling you ***** have been talking shit about you, he thinks he is so cheeky that he knows everything but he’s kinda right. You. Are. So. Bad.
~Why do you even exist in this world, can’t you see how disgusting, detestable and dumb you are, you should just go and join your family.
*Breathes heavily while looking straight into your eyes*
Oh, why are you here? Are you travelling somewhere? Have you heard, there's an airline on sale at the moment. Let me see… it's called go back to your room airways. GET OUT OF MY SIGHT
Do you have dirt in your eyes because don’t you realise how disgusting you look, what’s with that mask? HAHAHAHAHAHA
Can you just rot already, there’s no point in conversing with you, it would make me look bad. *smirk*
~I'm so useless, so useless, why do I even exist here? I can’t wait to dig a hole and that will serve as my tomb and bring you along with me.
Don’t look at me, I'm scared my appearance would give you discomfort, please look away!!!! OR DIE!!!
Do you know that if you talk to me long enough, you will also be like me, brain dead, incapable of doing anything, so how about you walk away or let me end you?
Oh man you messed up today, this is the reason why people do not want to work with you anymore.
That chick nightmare i saw is already having a steady job, and she is the same age as me!! Meanwhile i'm here talking to you, not knowing what i should do with my life…. calling is, HOW PATHETIC THE BOTH OF US CAN BE
~…………. Nothing you do will redeem yourself, You should just end it all along with us……
Everything around me looks… so…. Colourless….. Even the food I eat is tasteless… Will you taste better?
I must be in a nightmare…. You are experiencing this nightmare now, how about you stay here with me too? FOREVER!!
Please end me….. You can do that right? Just one attack and I will be dead… or we can do the opposite
How come only bad things happen to good people…… Why do I have to suffer…It must be your doing!!!!
~Do you know how much I sacrificed to make sure you don’t slip away?
I am the only soul in this world that trusts you so why do you want to LEAVE HERE!?
Everything happens for a reason, and you are the cause of it, You can talk to me!! I can help you out! … Anything you need… Just trust me PLEASE!
This nightmare is part of your life, You can’t control what’s happening inside, you need to get used to it!
Nightmares happen all the time and so do all people. You need to stop acting like a kid and DEAL WITH IT!
