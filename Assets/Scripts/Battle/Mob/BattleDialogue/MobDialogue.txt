It's you! WHY do you have the guts to show your face here?

Seeing you being mad out of nowhere is [really concerning]
Just [hoping] you can tell me what is wrong
Know that I can do [whatever I want] here
///
It's because of your incompetence that I'm stuck here
You're wrong! [Don't blame on me]
I just want you [to be happy] here
What you're suffering now [will be over soon]
Then [accept how it is] and leave me alone
///
You should be grateful that I'm talking to you
Can you be more [mature] about this?

Don't talk to me please, I may vomit!

I'm [sad] that you keep hurting me
Don't look at me so [negatively please]
But you and I are [not so different]

You're not even worth my time
Then why are you [still talking to me?]
Why do you keep [hurting me]
[Please don't] say things like this
Maybe I'm the one [wasting my saliva]

I'm so [disappointed] that you blame me
It might be grim now but [don't lose hope]
[Accept this situation] and you'll be better
///
You can't be Alex because you are so different from him
People change but I'm [still me]
I'm [conflicted] that you say I'm different now
Well [hopefully] this clear any confusion, I'm still me
Whether you like it or not, [I'm just myself]
///
Seeing your presence alone makes me uncomfortable
Then leave me to [make yourself feel better]
Then do whatever to [make you happy]
Please don't be negative and [it will help you!]
I [already know] you'll say something like this

The moment we start this conversation, I'm in pain
Getting dramatic [won't solve anything.]
[Trust me...] this will be over soon
Don't be [so negative] about anything
You're the one [that tried] to talk to me
<SPLIT>
It's you! Now I can finally unleash all my hate towards you
Is that the [first thing] you say to people?
Did you say this to [piss me off?] 
[Hope the hate] you have will be gone later
[Know that hate] is not the way to solve problem
///
Why can't you just die?

[It's bad for you mentally] to think this way
[Just wish] you stop acting like this
Know that dying is just [running away from problems]

///
I think I'm going to end my life now, you should join me too
[I won't join you!] So you should give up on dying
You're [making me sad] if you're just giving in like this
I just [hope you can be more mature] about this
[Accept that] having a companion to join you doesn't mean you're free

Just hope you can also see the good in people, [not everyone is bad]
[Everyone is not perfect] and that's fine
<SPLIT>
It's you! Have you finally come to let me help you free from your suffering?
Why do I need help when [I'm fine?]
I think you should [help yourself] first before helping others
I don't think I need any help now [but maybe in the future]
Appreciated it but know that [not everyone wants help]
///
I sacrificed a lot to make sure you don't die
Must be your imagination cause [I'm always on my own]

I just hope [stop thinking yourself as some sort of a savior]
I know you want to [help me] but I don't need it
